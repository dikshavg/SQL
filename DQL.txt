Overview of SQL Statement:
1)Data Definition language(DDL)
2)Data Manipulation language(DML)
3)transactions control language(TCL)
4)Data control language(DCL)
5)Data Query language(DQL)
===========================================================
1)Data Query language(DQL):
->DQL is used to fetch or retrieve the data from the data base
->it has 4 statements:
i)select
ii)projection
iii)selection
iv)joins

i)select:
->it is used  to retrieve the data from the table and display it

ii)projection:
->it is process of retrieving the data by selecting only columns
syntax:
select * /column_name/Expression
from table_name; 

*order of execution:
1)from clause
2)select clause

*Expression: it is the statement which gives the result
->its a combination of operators and operand

*Operand: it is the value which is pass to the Operator

*Operator: it is a Special Symbols which perform some OPerations

iii)Selection:
it is the process of selecting the both column and row
->to select particular record we need to write a condition, to write a condition we use where clause

*where clause:
is use to filter the records 
->where clause execute row by row
->in where clause we write filter condition
->to write multiple condition we go for logical operators
->and it have to return Boolean values

*logical Operator:
1)AND
2)OR
3)NOT 

1)AND: it is used whenever we have to satisfy multiple conditions
2)OR: it is used whenever we have satisfy at least 1 of the condition
3)NOT: it is used when ever we have to reject the particular condition
