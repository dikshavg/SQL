*Number:
->number datatype accepts only numeric-values that is '0-9' number can be a +ve or -ve.
Syntax: number(precision[,scale])
note:
precision: it is used to determine total no of int digits used in a value.
->max precision can be 38
Scale: it is used to determine total no of decimal digits used in a value and scale block gets created within the precision
->The max-Scale can be 127
->Scale is a Optional, So the default value of Scale is 0.
ex: number(5,2):999.99

**Large Objects:
1)character large object:
->it is used to store character up to 4GB of size

2)Binary large Object:
->it is used to store Binary values of images,MP3,MP4 and games up to 4GB of size

*Constraints:
->are the rule assign to a column for Extra validation
 
**Types of Constraints:
1)Unique
2)Not null
3)Check
4)Primary key
5)Foreign key/Referential integrity constant

1)Unique:
->it is used to avoid repeated or duplicated values

2)Not null:
->it is used to avoid null values.
1)Null means nothing or Empty
2)O is not null value
3)null doesn't occupies any memory
4)100+null=null

3)Check:
->check is extra validation with a condition
->if the given condition is true then the value will be accepted else rejected
check(condition)
 
4)primary key:
->is a constraints which is used to identify a record uniquely from the table
character of Primary key:
->primary key will not accept unique
->primary key will not accept null values
->its a combination of unique and not-null constraint.
->we can have only 1 primary key in a table

5)Foreign key:
->used to establish the connection between the tales and it is also known as referential integrity constant
->can accept unique
->can accept not null
->its not a combination of unique & not-null.
->we can have multiple foreign keys in table.
