
**Structured Query language:(SQL)
->SQL is used to communicate or interact or deals with the Database software.
==================================================================================
*Data:
->data is a raw fact which describes the Attributes or properties of an Entity.
==================================================================================
*Database:
->is a place or medium or container in which we store the data in a Systematics and organized manner
->we can perform some Operations on Database:
i)create/Insert
ii)Read/Retrieve
iii)Update/Modify
iv)Drop/Delete
->these Operations are Universally referred as 'CRUD' operations
===================================================================================
*Database Management System(DBMS):
->DBMS is a Software which is used to maintain and the manage the database
->DBMS stores the data in the form of files.
->it provides 2 important features: Security, Authorization.
->we use Query language to communicate or Interact with DBMS software.

**Types of DBMS/database:
1)Network DBMS
2)Hierarchical DBMS
3)Relational DBMS 
4)Object Oriented DBMS

**Relational Database management System(RDBMS):
->DBMS is a type of DBMS software which stores the data in the form of tables.
->it provides 2 important features called Security and Authorization
->we use Structured Query language(SQL) to communicate or interact with RDBMS.

**Relational Model:
->Relational model was introduces by E.F Codd in 1970.
->any DBMS software which follows relational model then it will became RDBMS
->E.F codd gave a main rule in RDBMS that is Everything should be store in the form of 'Tables'.

*Table:->
->Table is logical organization of a data which consists of Rows, columns and Cell

**Rules of E.F codd:
1)The Data entered into a cell must be Single value data to prevent 'data loss'.
2)In RDBMS Everything should be stored in the form of tables including 'Metadata'.

*Metadata:details of the data is known as Metadata.
->Metadata can stored into Metadata and Metatable will be generated Automatically by Software itself. 

3)According to e.f codd we can store data into multiple tables,if needed we can establish connection between the table using "key-attribute".
4)we can validate the data by 2 steps:
->by assigning datatypes
->by assigning constrains for the columns.
======================================================================================================================================================
Datatype:
->are used to determine what type or kind of the data can be stored to a particular column or memory location.
*types of Datatype:
1)Char
2)Varchar/varchar2
3)Date
4)Large Object:
->Character large object
->Binary large object

1)Char:
->char datatype accepts the following:
'A-Z','a-z','0-9','&','$',------'Space' or combination of all
Synatx: char(size)
->whenever we use char datatype passing size as an argument is mandatory
->Size determines the no. of memory blocks
->Maximun size can 2000
->character must always be enclosed within ''
->it follows fixed length memory allocation
ex:pan,ifsc,id etc

2)Varchar:
->char datatype accepts the following:
'A-Z','a-z','0-9','&','$',------'Space' or combination of all
Synatx: varchar(size)
->whenever we use char datatype passing size as an argument is mandatory
->Size determines the no. of memory blocks
->Maximun size can 2000
->character must always be enclosed within ''
->it follows variable length memory allocation 
ex:name,address,job,amilid

*varchar2:
->it is updated version of varchar datatype
->we can store up to 4000 character

3)Date:
->it is used to stored only date to a particular column
->it accepts only oracle specify date formats and  date must be enclosed within ''
Synatx: Date
->oracle specified date format:
1)'DD-Mon-YYYY'
2)'DD-Mon-YY'
